Hello World!

### "The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence."

My Name is Shubham Kumar Gupta. I am working in Software Industry since 2019. Currently I am working in L&T Infotech as Senior Software Engineer. Before this I used to work as TCS as System Engineer and I also worked as a trainee Software Engineer for a company in Noida known as OCSBOX.

I mostely got a chance to work on Pyhton3 and it's data science liberaries. Also I am Planning for my GCP Certification.

Regards,
Shubham Kumar Gupta ðŸš€
